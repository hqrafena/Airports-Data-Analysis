### Loading the library

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

### Loading data

```{r}
my_airports <- read.csv("airports.csv", header = TRUE)
```

## How many airports are between 42 and 43 degrees latitude?
 
### filtering airports between the latitudes

```{r}
airport_id <- subset(my_airports, Latitude >=42 & Latitude <=43)
```

### the number of airports

```{r}
nrow(airport_id) 
```

## What is the altitude of the airport in Idaho Falls, Idaho (IDA)?

### Only selecting airportID, name, city, IATA, altitude

```{r}
idaho_airport <- select(my_airports, Name, City, IATA, Altitude)
```

### Filtering for Idaho Fall, Idaho(IDA)

```{r}
filter(idaho_airport, City == "Idaho Falls")
```

## what is the airport ID and altitude of the highest airport in the dataset?

### filter only the airport ID and altitude from the highest_airport

```{r}
#high_alt_port <- select(my_airports, airport_id, Altitude, Name)#
```

### Checking the airport id column type

```{r}
str(my_airports)
```

### Changing airport id column type

```{r}
my_airports$AirportID <- as.factor(my_airports$AirportID)
```

### Now airport id is a categorical variable or factor

```{r}
str(my_airports)
```

### using subset to find info about the highest altitude of the airports

```{r}
highest_airport <- subset(my_airports, Altitude==max(Altitude))
```

### Finding the airport ID of the highest altitude airport

```{r}
select(highest_airport, AirportID, Altitude)
```

## what is the airport ID and altitude of the lowest airport in the dataset?

### Only selecting airport id, altitude and name

```{r}
filter_airport <- select(my_airports, AirportID, Altitude)
```

### finding the airport id and altitude of the lowest airport

```{r}
subset(filter_airport, Altitude==min(Altitude))
```
