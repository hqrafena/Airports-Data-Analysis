# Airports-Data-Analysis
This is a repository of data analysis on airports in the USA to answer specific question by using R programming.

I will answer the following questions:
How many airports are between 42 and 43 degrees latitude?
What is the altitude of the airport in Idaho Falls, Idaho (IDA)?
what is the airport ID and altitude of the highest airport in the dataset?
what is the airport ID and altitude of the lowest airport in the dataset?

Thanks to one of my gradaute school professors for providing this dataset.
